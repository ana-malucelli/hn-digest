"""Tests for the scorer module."""

# TODO: write tests for score_story() and rank_stories() once implemented.
#
# Ideas:
# - test that a story with higher score ranks above one with lower score
# - test that a story with more comments ranks higher than one with none
# - test that rank_stories returns stories in descending order
# - test rank_stories with an empty list
# - test rank_stories with a single story
